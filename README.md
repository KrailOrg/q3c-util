# q3c-util

A fairly random collection of utilities, used primarily in [Krail](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail), but has found uses in other places.

It contains the following packages:


## clazz

A mix of classes which identify the unenhanced class from a byte enhanced object

## dag

- A dynamic Directed Acyclic Graph (dynamic in the sense that it checks for cycles as items are added) 

## forest

- A semantic wrapper over a [Jung graph](http://jung.sourceforge.net/), providing Tree like syntax for manipulation

## guava

- A Guava Cache configuration object

## reflect

- Ignore - just one old class which has been deprecated
